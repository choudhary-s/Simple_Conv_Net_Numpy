This is numpy implementation of a simple convolutional neural network. 

Convolutional networks are great for image data.

Through this I have tried to implement a simple convolutional neural network, so that I can understand the concept of convolution more deeply.

Here, I have taken help from this https://becominghuman.ai/only-numpy-implementing-convolutional-neural-network-using-numpy-deriving-forward-feed-and-back-458a5250d6e4

Please read the above cited page if you want to understand my code.
